                                               						PROJECT PROPOSAL
TITLE:Credit Power-up

ABSTRACT: We have successfully started the data gathering process in the first week of the project's execution, and we have also merged datasets, which has moved us a step closer to the data repository. The phases of data analysis pertaining to the credit factors have also been determined. There were issues, such as the need to clean up the bad data quality. Our data collecting procedure was held down by some challenges with authorization access. We will continue to integrate data and sanitise it to obtain a more refined version for our data sources.

Our database formatting was done with SQL, and we also created a SQL diagram for it.
