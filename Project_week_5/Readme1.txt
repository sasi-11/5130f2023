PROJECT TITLE : Credit Power-Up

In our fifth week, we made few changes to the final coding blocks and set up everything as needed. 

Together, as a dynamic team, we are not only celebrating past successes but also proactively steering our efforts towards the continuous improvement and application of our profile system in the dynamic landscape of e-commerce monitoring.

The files attached shows the progress for this week on our project.
