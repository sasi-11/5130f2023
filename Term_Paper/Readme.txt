TITLE: Distributed Multilevel Secure Data Stream Processing

ABSTRACT: Data Stream Management Systems (DSMSs) have been proposed to address the data processing needs of situationmonitoring applications that collect high-speed data from various sources, compute results on-the-fly, and take actions in realtime. Traditional DSMSs are not suitable for processing military applications which involve data belonging to multiple security levels and there are rules governing information flow. Moreover, a centralized DSMS may not be suitable for military applications. Towards this end, we propose a distributed multilevel secure DSMS systems. We provide an architecture and an implementation and demonstrate how simple queries can be executed in our system.
