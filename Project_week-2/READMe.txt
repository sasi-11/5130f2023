TITLE:Credit Power-up

We completed requirement gathering during the first week of the project's implementation, and the software development team is now working to complete the project. The team attempts to extract as much information as it can about the requirements by holding talks with different stakeholders from the issue area. The requirements are thought through and divided into three categories: functional, system, and user requirements. Following requirement collection, the team develops a preliminary software process plan. At this point, the team assesses if the programme can be developed to meet every user need and whether it may eventually become obsolete.The viability of the project from a financial, practical, and technological standpoint for the organisation is determined. Numerous methods are available to assist developers in determining if a software project is feasible. We do system analysis, and during this phase, the developers choose a plan's roadmap and work to identify the optimal software model for the project. Understanding software product constraints, learning about system-related issues or necessary modifications to already-existing systems, determining and resolving the project's influence on the organisation and its workers, and other things are all included in system analysis. The project team evaluates the project's scope before allocating resources and creating a timeline.
