PROJECT TITLE : Credit Power-Up

Report:

Problem Statement:
The document outlines plans for developing a new web-based e-commerce system to facilitate online retail transactions. The goal is to build a user-friendly platform that enables customers to easily search for, purchase, and review products, while providing administrators tools to manage inventory, orders, and customer reviews.

Alternative Approaches:
Potential approaches for developing the platform include:
1) Building a custom solution from scratch using Java technologies like Spring MVC and Hibernate. This offers flexibility but requires significant development effort.  
2) Using an open-source e-commerce platform like Magento or WooCommerce. This leverages existing code but has less flexibility.
3) Purchasing a proprietary software product from a vendor. This simplifies implementation but incurs licensing fees.


Launch instructions:The document outlines plans to develop a custom solution using Java technologies including Servlets, JSP, JDBC, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Reasons this approach was selected include:

- Ability to fully customize features and functionality to exact business needs
- Leveraging the power and widespread adoption of Java for web applications
- Support for modern architectural approaches like MVC to aid extensibility 
- Cost savings relative to purchasing proprietary software
- More control compared to open source solutions with hardcoded features

The goal is to develop an intuitive, user-friendly application providing all required e-commerce capabilities. The use of standard Java frameworks aligned with MVC principles aims to achieve a flexible foundation for current needs with ability to adapt to future business requirements.
